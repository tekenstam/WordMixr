## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose

### 1. Download and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wordmixr.git
cd wordmixr

# Start the application
docker compose up --build
```

### 2. Access the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 3. Try It Out

1. **Enter letters** (e.g., "beach", "scramble", "listen")
2. **Set minimum word length** (3+ letters recommended)
3. **Click "Solve Words"** to find all possible words
4. **Click words** to mark them as found (they'll move to bottom and grey out)
5. **Try "Find Anagrams"** for exact letter matches

## ü§ñ Automated Dependency Management

WordMixr uses **Dependabot** to automatically keep dependencies up-to-date:

- **üì¶ Frontend**: npm packages (React, TypeScript, Vite)
- **üêç Backend**: Python packages (FastAPI, Pydantic)
- **üê≥ Docker**: Base images and Docker actions
- **‚ö° GitHub Actions**: Workflow dependencies

Dependabot runs weekly and creates PRs for security updates and version bumps. See [`docs/DEPENDABOT.md`](docs/DEPENDABOT.md) for detailed configuration.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start application (detached)
docker compose up --build -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop application
docker compose down

# Restart with fresh build
docker compose down && docker compose up --build -d
```

## Example Usage

**Find words from "BEACH":**
- Results: `beach`, `each`, `ache`, `bach`, `cab`, `ace`
- Interactive: Click words to mark as found

**Find anagrams of "LISTEN":**
- Results: `listen`, `silent`, `enlist`, `tinsel`, `inlets`

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Dictionaries**: SCOWL Large (126k curated words, optimized for word games)

## Word Quality

WordMixr uses **SCOWL Large dictionary** (126k curated words) by default, specifically optimized for word puzzle games:

‚úÖ **Includes critical words** like "ache" and "gird" that other dictionaries miss  
‚úÖ **No profanity** - family-friendly word list  
‚úÖ **No noise** - excludes Latin terms, abbreviations, and nonsensical combinations  
‚úÖ **Game-tested** - verified with Word Cookies and similar puzzle games

üìñ **See [DEVELOPER.md](DEVELOPER.md)** for comprehensive documentation

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
```bash
docker compose down
# Edit ports in docker-compose.yml if needed
docker compose up --build
```

**Can't connect to backend:**
- Ensure backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Check Docker logs: `docker compose logs backend`

**Dictionary issues:**
- Verify dictionary files exist in `backend/app/`
- Check configuration: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
