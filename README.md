WordMixr uses **SCOWL Large dictionary** (126k curated words) by default, specifically optimized for word puzzle games:

âœ… **Includes critical words** like "ache" and "gird" that other dictionaries miss  
âœ… **No profanity** - family-friendly word list  
âœ… **No noise** - excludes Latin terms, abbreviations, and nonsensical combinations  
âœ… **Game-tested** - verified with Word Cookies and similar puzzle games
